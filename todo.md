# TODO

- [x] move the DB connection into the controller.
- [ ] read in the private key (PEM?) for encoding and decoding JWT tokens
- [ ] Make a clear list of the routes I need to implement for creating a User
- [ ] Add tests to the Docker CI so that I can check to see if the routes are implemented properly
- [ ] Write up issues for Connor related to building out the UI for the routes I'm implementing.
